# Šlamastika
Šlamastika is a simple HTML page that stores your Markdown notes in browser's [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).

## Usage
1. Open the [demo page](https://sobkulir.github.io/slamastika)
2. Add your notes
3. If you like it, bookmark it.

## Credits
I took the idea from [Rik Wanders](https://github.com/gitaarik) back in 2016.
